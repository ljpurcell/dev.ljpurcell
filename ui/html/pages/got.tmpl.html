    <h1 id="got">GOT</h1>
    <p>Like Git, but in Go.</p>
    <p>Got is a command-line application developed in Go, functioning as a basic version control system similar to Git.
        It allows users to perform essential operations like initializing repositories, staging changes, committing
        snapshots, and checking out versions, leveraging Goâ€™s robust file handling and command-line utilities.</p>
    <h2 id="purpose">Purpose</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Develop a deeper understanding of how Git works</li>
        <li>
            <p>Build proficiency with Go, particularly working with files</p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Repository Initialization (<code>init</code> command):</strong> Sets up a new repository
                        by creating necessary directory structures and initializing a HEAD file, which tracks the
                        current branch.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Staging Changes (<code>add</code> and <code>remove</code> commands):</strong> Manages the
                        staging area, where changes are prepped for commits. Involves updating the index with file
                        statuses.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Committing Changes (<code>commit</code> command):</strong> Takes a snapshot of the staged
                        changes, creating a commit object that includes metadata like the commit message and parent
                        commit. When committed, files are compressed (using zlib) and this snapshot can be identified by
                        the resulting SHA-1 hash.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Checkout Feature (<code>checkout</code> command):</strong> Allows users to revert their
                        working directory to the state of a specific commit, identified by its hash.</p>
