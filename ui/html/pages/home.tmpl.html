<h1>
    Hi my name is Lyndon.
</h1>
<div>
    I'm a <span class="font-bold">software engineer</span> who builds web applications, command line tools, and
    automation scripts.
</div>
<div>
    I have a deep interest in programs that are not only <span class="font-bold">correct</span> but also <span
        class="font-bold">efficient</span>.
</div>

<div>
    This leads me to topics such as data structures and algorithms, and performance optimisation. I stil have a lot
    to
    learn, but my
    goal is to bring knowledge, skill, and polish to how software is constructed.
