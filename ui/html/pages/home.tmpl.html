        Hi, my name is <span class="emphasize">Lyndon</span>.

        I'm a <span class="emphasize">software engineer</span> who builds web applications, command line
        tools, and automation scripts.
    </h2>

    <h2>
        I have a deep interest in creating things that are not only <span class="emphasize">correct</span>,
        but <span class="emphasize">efficient</span>.
    </h2>

    <h3>
        This leads me to topics such as <span class="emphasize">data structures</span>, <span

    <h3>
        I still
        have a lot
        to
        learn, but my
        goal is to bring <span class="emphasize">knowledge</span>, <span class="emphasize">skill</span>, and <span
            class="emphasize">polish</span> to how <span class="emphasize">software is
            constructed</span>.
