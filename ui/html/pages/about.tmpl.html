<h1>About</h1>
<p>Hi, I&#39;m Lyndon. </p>
<p>I’m a software engineer with a keen interest in backend technologies, and a particular fondness for Go. I love
    solving problems and thinking about systems. My career has been non-linear, and
    includes roles such as strength coach, data analyst, and mental health service coordinator. This broad
    range of experience has been invaluable for my development.</p>
<h2 id="technical-interests">Technical Interests</h2>
<h3>Go</h3>
<p>When programming, I&#39;m having the most fun (and doing my best work) when using a statically-typed, lower-level
    language. My introduction to programming was C.
    I&#39;m drawn to Go as it allows me to handle the lower-level operations that I find most interesting about
    programming, whilst being remarkably productive, performant, and not abusing abstraction. My goal is to become
    <em>a wizard</em> at Go.
</p>
<h3>Data Structures &amp; Algorithms</h3>
<p>I’m drawn to data structures and algorithms because they are the bedrock of efficient software. Faster software, that
    uses less resources, <em>is better</em>. Many modern technologies try to
    prevent programmers from needing to think about memory within the computer, or how costly it will be to add an
    element to a collection; but I think this is important. A developer can still make tremendous progress on what they
    are
    building while taking care along the way to make sure their solution is efficient.</p>
<h2 id="me-the-person">Me, The Person</h2>
<h3>Life Philosphy</h3>
<p>I strive to understand the world more deeply as well as make it a better place. I&#39;m committed to ongoing
    learning, challenging my perspectives, and shedding irrational beliefs. Additionally, I donate to impactful
    charities every month and get involved in the Effective Altruism community where I can. Developing myself
    continuously, in the spirit of <em>Kaizen</em>, and then paying it forward in some way is how I try to live my life.
</p>
<h3>Learning</h3>
<p>Reading is fundamental to my learning. My bookshelf is packed with works on moral philosophy,
    cognitive psychology, evolution, as well as classic sci-fi like <em>Dune</em> and <em>Foundation</em>. I also
    <em>love</em> to write. Previously, I had a blog named <em>ThereforeThink</em> where I wrote about
    self-development and had over one thousand subscribers. More recently, <a href="/project/portfolio">building this
        very site</a> has allowed me to explore and share my technical passions.
</p>
<h3>Leisure</h3>
<p>In my downtime, I love returning to where I grew up and spending time on the farm. I also like to stay fit and
    healthy, spend time with friends outdoors, and watch cartoons.</p>

    Whether you’re a fellow developer, a potential collaborator, or just here to explore, I’m glad you stopped by. I’m
    always interested in discussing technology, new projects, and ideas that challenge the status quo. Let's connect!
